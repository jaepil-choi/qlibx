"""Shared upstream stubs for ``comp_industry`` tests and golden generators.

``comp_industry`` calls ``comp_sic_naics(paths)`` and ``hgics_join(paths)``
before running its own DuckDB SQL.  When testing ``comp_industry`` in
isolation we stub both calls to no-ops so only the SQL is exercised.

This module is the single source of truth for those stubs, used by:

- ``tests.unit.test_comp_industry`` (via ``patch_comp_industry_upstream_stubs``)
- ``tests.golden.generate_comp_industry_golden`` (via ``comp_industry_upstream_stubs``)
